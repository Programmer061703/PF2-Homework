After many years of Turmoil and interferences from forgien powers the glorious country of South Sudan has begun its millitary conquest
Assembling a battalion of Panzer II from the fallen Third Reich their fearless leader Promises to restore South Sudan to its former Glory
The March of Panzers and Soldiers began March 3rd 2045 as they began their frontal assault on Sudan deeming them Inferrior to the might of South Sudan
Sudan fell within 3 months as the years of internal warfare caused the government to destabalize when South Sudan began its march
As South Sudan planted its glorious flag on its rival, the neihboring country CHAD ammassed a force of 50,000 to counterattack the defensless country of South Sudan
3 Months of constant seige from CHAD, South Sudans forces were to far away to assist, the Emperor activated the last plan
After the fall of Soviet Union in 1991 South Sudan had aquired a large nuclear arsenal, as a last resort began firing them at every mainland it could reach
The Nuclear Fallout plunged the world into a Thousand year darkness, other than that GLORY TO SOUTH SUDAN
